Pipette-Guide-96
================
Making you hate normalization from 96-well plates less.
------------------------------------------------------------

Have to add or take different volumes to/from each well of a 96 well plate?
Here is a way to do it with minimal adjusting of your pipette. Start with higher volumes and go down. <br>
Open a custom html file in your tablet, transfer the highest-volume remaining (highlighted in yellow), and click to find the next highest well. <br>

To run:
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Download the repository folder via the button on the right and unzip <br> 
2) Paste desired volumes into volumes.csv <br>
3) Double click on generate.sh <br>
4) Open the updated index.html on your tablet/phone and get pipetting. <br>

Tips:
------------------------------------------------------------
-For easy finding of wells, draw 3 lines on your 96 well plate, as shown in red on the pipette guide. (Between rows D&E, columns 4&5, and columns 8&9) <br>
-A shared dropbox between your PC and tablet will allow you to easily open index.html on your tablet. <br>
-Feel free to rename index.html, so that you can have one html file per plate. <br>
-As of December 2014, there are suitable tablets available online for less than $50 (e.g. bestbuy.com, newegg.com)
